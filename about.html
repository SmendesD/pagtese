    <h1>ABOUT</h1></div>
<p>With the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic, we experienced several changes in our lives. As a result of these changes, not only people, but also the planet, in general, felt these variations.
    Some of these effects occurred at the sound level, namely in the sound identity, since the human presence became absent in the urban environment, making nature more audible in certain areas.
    Thus, this project aims at creating a platform to gather sound recordings in different open spaces, both rural and urban, in order to try to understand the changes in sound environments that happened due to the pandemic.
